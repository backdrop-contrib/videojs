# Video.js Filter

This is really simple module that provides a text format filter for the Video.js module.

To embed a video file add the token with format `[videojs:VIDEOFILE|poster:POSTERFILE|width:WIDTH|height:WIDTH]`. Replace the capitalized parts with values. Only VIDEOFILE is required; the rest will be filled in the defaults. Example: `[videojs:mycatvideo.mp4]`.

## Installation & setup.

Turn on module, go to text formats page and turn on filter. Put you videos in some separate folder in the Backdrop files directory, and configure settings on admin/config/media/videojs/videojs_filter.
